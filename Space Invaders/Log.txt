Todo:


- Migrate protocols to the GameProtocols.h file. (if compiler complains about types use @class)  //COMPLETE

- Flock AI
        -> Move Invaders in x,y direction
        -> increase movement speed as number of invaders decreases //COMPLETE
        -> remove invaders from the grid  //COMPLETE
        
- Add Sound

- Implement a score system

- Implement a Game Menu

- Implement Spaceship's collision detection  

- Throw exceptions when:
        -> Flock is null but invaders are being added to game
        -> when processTurn method in gameobject is not being overriden
        
- InvaderFlock::getXBound should be changed so the for loop is generic and does not only iterate to kINVADERS_PER_ROW this will not work on ipad

- Instead of Invader delegate and Invader AI method releasing invaders and missiles respectively, memory should be freed in the GameObject::destroy method
